Functional interface :
    It's an interface that contains exactly one abstract method.
    It can have multiple static and default methods but must have a one single abstract method to qualify as a functional interface.
    @FunctionalInterface : This annotation indicates that an interface is functional.

    below are the pre-defined functional interfaces :
        Runnable
        Callable<T>
        Comparator<T>
        Predicate<T>

    Functional interface enables the lambda expressions in java8 and beyond.
