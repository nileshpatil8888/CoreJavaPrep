Inheritance :
        Inheritance is used for hierarchy which helps us to reuse the methods and avoid code duplication

        Definition : It inherits properties from another class

        There are some different types of inheritance
        1.single inheritance :
          Single inheritance means it inherit properties from their parent class.
            real world example : i.e. our parent  : some of the qualities from parent have their child.

        2.multilevel inheritance :
            in multilevel inheritance child class inherit properties from their parent class and others inherit from child class.

        3.multiple inheritance
          This is not supported by java.
            why not supported : If a class inherits from two classes that have method with the same signature so it confused to compiler which needs to be compiled, and it creates ambiguity so that's why multiple not supported by java.
              But still we can achieve this with the help of interfaces in java. : An interface allows a class to "inherit" method declarations from multiple sources,
              without the complications of state or conflicting method implementations.

        4.hierarchical inheritance
          When two or more classes inherit a single class that's known as hierarchical inheritance.

        5.hybrid inheritance
          more than one type of inheritance mechanism is combined in a single program. (types combined).
