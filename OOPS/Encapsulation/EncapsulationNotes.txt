Encapsulation :

        Wrapping up data into single unit is called as encapsulation.

        Example : all the classes and methods are wrapping with packages together so that's where the encapsulation comes in place.

        It's restricting the access with the help of access modifiers.

        Real world example : ATM : Internal verification are hidden from the user , how much balance is their, cash dispensing etc.
                        Also it is having controlled access, till the user provides correct pin then only it can access his account.
