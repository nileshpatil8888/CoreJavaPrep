Polymorphism :
        Polymorphism know with a greek word that s poly means many and morph means forms. it helps to do the operations in different ways.
        Allows us single interface to represent different forms.
        It provides flexibility and reusability in code.

        There are two types of polymorphism :
            compile-time polymorphism :
                This is achieved via method overloading.
                    Method overloading : if multiple methods have same name but different parameters that's known as method overloading.

            Run-time polymorphism :
                This is achieved via method overriding.
                    Method overriding : If multiples methods have same name and same parameters that's known as method overriding.
